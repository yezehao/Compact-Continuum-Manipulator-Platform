\section*{Abstract} 
The robotic manipulator plays a crucial role in mitigating the labor for people across different fields. This project designed a 
specialized 4-unit fishbone continuum manipulator intended for medical applications. The end effector of this manipulator is 
going to be equipped with a Focused Ultrasound (FUS) transducer, enabling the eradication of tumor tissues within the human body. 
The project methodology is divided into three parts, including modeling and strain analysis, derivation of forward and inverse 
kinematics, and actuation control strategies. 

Through this approach, a viable design solution for the continuum manipulator has been crafted. By using 8 motors to control 
the 8 cables of the manipulator separately, we achieved an 8 DOF configuration with a working space of 300x300x300mm. The 
resulting manipulator boasts user-friendly operation, affordability, and remarkable precision. At the same time, there are 
still some improvements to be made to optimize the design, namely the closed-loop feedback systems and the structural strength 
analysis. 

Looking ahead, the project should focus on the transition toward the practical manufacturing phase, where the simulation result a
nd parameters can be verified by producing a real manipulator prototype.
