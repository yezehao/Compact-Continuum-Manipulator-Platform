This section shows the code and wiring schematic for testing the MPU6050. Since Proteus does not support the simulation function of MPU6050, the code has been verified successfully by physical verification, and the measured results can be displayed through the serial monitor. For physical control, this code needs to be ported to the Tof ranging code and the detected structures displayed through the OLED screen.
