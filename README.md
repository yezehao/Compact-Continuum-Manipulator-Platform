<summary>Objectives</summary>

- [ ] Identify the most suitable design of tendon manipulators for this application,
- [ ] Design and simulate the kinetics and kinematics of the platform numerically,
- [ ] Optimise the design by minimising the dimensions of the platform,
- [ ] Propose suitable instrumentation and develop the required controller,
- [ ] Open-source project repository, including the codes, simulations and CAD files.
