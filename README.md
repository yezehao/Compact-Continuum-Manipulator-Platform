## Description
The project is proposed to develop a compact continuum robotic platform suitable for precisely manipulating ultrasonic transducers for laboratory experimental FUS studies. 

<details open>
<summary>Aim</summary>

The aim of the project is to develop a compact continuum robotic platform for precise manipulation of an *ultrasonic transducer* (`cylindrical`, `dimensions of 65x30 mm`, `weight < 0.8 kg`)

</details>


<details open>
<summary>Main Features</summary>

The features of the compact continuum manipulator platform are as follow:   
`compact`, `versatile`, `cost-effective`, `programmable`, `open-source`, `6-DOF`

The product is ideally consist of a *continuous robot*, a *driving system* and a *control system* developed using Arduino.

<summary>Objectives</summary>

- [ ] Identify the most suitable design of tendon manipulators for this application,
- [ ] Design and simulate the kinetics and kinematics of the platform numerically,
- [ ] Optimise the design by minimising the dimensions of the platform,
- [ ] Propose suitable instrumentation and develop the required controller,
- [ ] Open-source project repository, including the codes, simulations and CAD files.
